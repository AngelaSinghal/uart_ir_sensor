# uart_ir_sensor



This repository contains an embedded system project using a Texas Instruments (TI) C2000 microcontroller (e.g., F280x or F283xx) and Code Composer Studio (CCS) to build an infrared (IR) sensor-based object detector. The system:

* Employs an IR sensor to detect the presence of objects.
* Calculates the distance of the detected object.
* Adjusts the speed of a connected motor inversely proportional to the object's distance (closer objects lead to slower motor speeds).

**Hardware Requirements:**

* Texas Instruments C2000 microcontroller (e.g., F280x or F283xx) development board
* IR sensor module with appropriate output voltage level (3.3V or 5V)
* DC motor (specifications to match your project needs)
* Motor driver (if required by your motor's power rating)
* Connecting wires and breadboard (optional, depending on your development board)

**Software Requirements:**

* Texas Instruments Code Composer Studio (CCS) ([https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO))
* C/C++ development environment compatible with CCS ([Optional] If not using CCS built-in compiler)

**Project Structure:**

* **src:** Contains the source code files for the project (e.g., `main.c`, `ir_sensor.c`, `motor_control.c`).
* **include:** Holds header files with function prototypes and definitions (e.g., `ir_sensor.h`, `motor_control.h`).
* **doc:** Includes any additional documentation (e.g., schematics, user guide).
* **Makefile** or equivalent build script ([Optional] for automated compilation)

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install and configure CCS.** Follow TI's documentation for installing and configuring CCS on your development platform.
2. **Import the project files.** Import the project files from this repository into your CCS workspace.
3. **Configure hardware connections.** Refer to your hardware documentation to establish correct connections between the microcontroller, IR sensor, motor (via driver if needed), and power supply.
4. **Build and run the code.** Use CCS to build the project and download the code to your microcontroller.
5. **Test the system.** Place objects at varying distances from the IR sensor and observe motor speed changes.

**Code Breakdown (High-Level):**

* **`main.c`:** Initializes the microcontroller, configures peripherals (e.g., timers, GPIOs), and calls functions from other modules to handle sensor readings and motor control.
* **`ir_sensor.c`:** Handles communication with the IR sensor, reads sensor output values, and calculates object distance based on the sensor's characteristics.
* **`motor_control.c`:** Controls the connected motor using PWM signals, adjusting the duty cycle based on the calculated object distance (closer objects result in lower duty cycle and slower motor speed).

**Further Considerations:**

* **Calibration:** Ensure accurate distance measurements by calibrating the IR sensor's output with known object distances.
* **Noise filtering:** Implement filtering techniques to improve signal stability and reduce noise interference with sensor readings.
* **Motor control optimization:** Fine-tune motor control based on your specific motor and desired speed response.
* **Documentation:** Add detailed comments to the code and create a user guide to explain the system's functionality and usage.

**Additional Notes:**

* This README provides a general overview. Specific details will vary based on your chosen microcontroller, hardware components, and desired functionalities.
* Consult TI's documentation for your microcontroller and CCS for detailed information on configuration, peripherals, and development tools.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is provided as a basic outline. You'll need to fill in the specific details of the code, calibration methods, and motor control logic based on your chosen hardware and desired behavior.
